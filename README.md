# Hospital Management System

The Hospital Management System is designed to centralize and streamline the management of patient data, hospital operations, and healthcare services. By moving away from fragmented records and manual processes, the hospital aims to consolidate all relevant information into a single, efficient database. This transition enhances data accuracy, reduces administrative burdens, and improves overall operational efficiency.

## Primary Objective:
The primary goal of this database design is to create a structured and relational model that effectively manages patient records, staff details, room assignments, and medical procedures. It supports various hospital functions, including patient care management, staff scheduling, and room allocation. The system ensures data integrity, reduces duplication, and enables comprehensive data analysis, which is crucial for delivering high-quality patient care and making informed decisions.
